INSERT INTO `phrase` VALUES (1,'A backslide',' A lazy, irresponsible person who does not support a combines effort; someone who causes development to slide backwards rather than forwards; someone who can’t be trusted to get a job done.  “I see you have assigned Captain Morgan to my project. He’s a no-good backslider who will hinder rather than further the success of the mission.”  “Mallory is nothing but a backslider. He’s never done anything useful in his life that would bring credit to his name or family.”  “If I ever get my hands on that backslider, Mullins, I will kick him in the backside for letting down his wife and children by wasting his life on gambling and drink.”',NULL),(2,'A back-stabbe',' Just as a person may sneak up behind you to stick a knife in your back, so we can call a person a back-stabber who unexpectedly betrays your trust.  “Be careful who you trust, because even your best friend could turn out to be a backstabber.” “My first wife was a backbiting, backstabbing-bitch.” “I wouldn’t trust Charlie as far as I could throw him. He’s a liar, a thief and a back-stabber.”',NULL),(3,'A bad ome',' A bad sign which indicates that, when a bad thing happens, something even worse is going to happen. A sign that something bad or evil is going to come.  “It’s a bad omen that our son was born on Friday the thirteenth.” “They say it is a bad omen when a black cat crosses your path.” “It’s a bad omen when a voodoo witch smears, the blood of a chicken on your front door.” ',NULL),(4,'A baker’s dozen',' It used to be an old English marketplace tradition to pay for twelve bread rolls, and get one extra one, thrown in for good measure, to make a total of thirteen. “In the London market, a baker’s dozen doesn’t mean twelve. It means thirteen.” “Before Britain joined the European common market, people sold things by the dozen in units of twelve, or perhaps thirteen, if they gave the customer a baker’s dozen.” “We had thirteen children in our family, and father was fond of saying he had produced a baker’s dozen.”',NULL),(5,'A ballpark figure',' A guess as to how many people are in a baseball or football stadium; an approximate estimate of how-many or how-much. “I can’t tell you exactly how many spectators came to see the game, but if you want a ballpark figure, my estimate would be about sixty thousand.” “How  much is this wedding reception going to cost? Can you give me a ballpark figure?” “I hate it when people say they will give me a ballpark figure. What I want is an exact number and not an approximate guess.” ',NULL),(6,'A barefaced-lie',' A bold and brazen untruthful statement; a shameless, obvious lie. “Don’t try to tell me you gave the money to some poor old woman. That’s a brazen and barefacedlie!” “When you claim you don’t desire other women, I can see that you are telling a barefaced-lie.” “Don’t try to deny you stole the cookies; I know it is a bare-faced lie.”',NULL),(7,'A bee in her bonnet',' Just as woman with a bee in her hat (or bonnet) might run around, wildly, waving her hands in a panic, so we may say that a woman with an angry idea in her head reacts in frantic and frightful manner. “My Mom has got a bee in her bonnet about Father’s forgetting Valentine’s Day.” “Don’t run around like a woman with a bee in her bonnet just because someone said you are too tight and stingy.” “Aunt Caroline had a bee in her bonnet because the Ambassador had left her off the invitation list for Ladies’ Night.” ',NULL),(8,'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush',' Be satisfied with what you’ve got; don’t dream of what you have not. “If you let go of the bird that you have in your hand in hopes of catching two in the bushes, you will more than likely end-up empty-handed.” “It’s better to be thankful for what little you have; than being disappointed by unfulfilled desire for twice as much, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” “Be content with the one thing that you have rather than be discontented by two things you desire but are unlikely to get because a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” ',NULL),(9,'A bit beyond my ken',' Above my level of understanding; beyond my ability to grasp; more than I can comprehend; beyond my knowledge. “I could never understand the physics behind pressure points causing geological rifts on the sea-bed at the point where continental plates meet. It’s a bit beyond my ken.” “The justification for Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is a bit beyond my ken.” “It is beyond my ken why and how a whole galaxy can be sucked together and disappear into a black hole.” ',NULL),(10,'A bit dicey',' A little risky; chancy; a gamble, as in a throw of the dice; uncertain; not totally honest. “I wouldn’t invest any money in such a chancy venture. It seems a bit dicey to me.” “Don’t take any risks in business. Bet on a sure thing and avoid anything that looks dicey.” “I wouldn’t want to trust Charlie as a business consultant: his longshot ideas always seem a bit dicey to me.” * A bit dodgy  Dishonest; tricky; dicey; dubious; chancy risky. “A business that dodges the law is a dodgy business.’ “I wouldn’t invest money any of those pyramid schemes. They all seem a bit dodgy to me.” “It’s a bit risky to deposit money offshore in the hands of total strangers. It sounds a bit dodgy to me.” ',NULL),(11,'A bit much',' Over-exaggerated; over-stated; too flashy; over the top. “I found the accusations in your speech towards the Prime Minister a bit much, a bit over the top, I would say.” “Appearing in court with pink hair and a ring in your nose before the judge was a bit much. Don’t you think?” “I think that your leaving your wife at home alone, while attending a public reception with another woman, was a bit much!” ',NULL),(12,'A bit obtus',' A little dull and stupid; incapable of understanding; a bit thick; slow-witted; a little too-dumb to understand. “I didn’t understand you. I must be a bit obtuse. Can you explain it to me again?” “Being obtuse is no excuse. If you are too dull-witted to do this job, we’ll get someone to replace you.” “You must be a bit obtuse if you can’t even understand how to follow simple orders and directions.” ',NULL),(13,'A bit on the side',' When one has casual sexual relations outside the primary sexual partnership, we say that person is getting a bit on the side. “Tom and Tina seem to be the perfect married couple, but if Tina knew Tom was getting a bit on the side, she wouldn’t be so happy.” “My big sister, Kitty, says she wants to marry a rich, old man but keep a young boyfriend, at the same time, so she can get a bit on the side.” “Men are always dreaming about getting a bit on the side, but they would never dream that wives might be dreaming about the same thing.” * A bit out of it Mentally out of contact with the world; not quite all there; not with it; out of the picture. “Excuse me, if I don’t seem to be listening. Today I’m a bit out of it because of the drugs the doctor gave me.” “My girlfriend has just broken-off with me. I can’t concentrate on my work; I’m a bit out of it.” “Pay no attention to my idiot brother. He’s a bit out of it; he’s not all there you know.”',NULL),(14,'A bloodsucke',' Just as a leech sticks to you and sucks your blood, so another person may be said to stick to you, like a parasite, in order to obtain personal gain and benefit. “My first wife drained my bank account, just in the way a leech sucks blood from the body. She was a real bloodsucker.” “Harvey’s wife, Lolita, is the kind of person who just wants to marry for money. She’s nothing but a bloodsucker.” “Don’t be such a bloodsucker, and stop leeching off your friends all the time.” *',NULL),(15,'A brainwave',' An unexpected clever idea or insight; a stroke of genius; a sudden inspiration. “I had the brainwave of installing a Bluetooth System in my car radio, connected to the GPS, which would allow the car to run more-or-less on autopilot. Tests begin tomorrow.” “Who was it who had the brainwave to inflate big air balloons by burning nitrogen?” “Einstein was the genius who had the brainwave that the speed of a moving particle in a relative relationship to another moving particle could be measured.” ',NULL),(16,'A breath of fresh air',' Just as we feel better after going outside a stifling, suffocating, boring environment to get a breath of fresh air, so it can be refreshing when someone or something new enters into a stuffy atmosphere. “When Tony Blair, was elected, Prime Minister, he brought a breath of fresh air into an otherwise conservative and boring, British political world.” “When young Jane joined the staff, she was like a breath of fresh air in an otherwise, stuffy and stagnant atmosphere.” “It was a real breath of fresh air when the Judge called in Cheery Cherry, Mr. Wong’s, exgirlfriend, to the witness stand in to tell all she knew.” ',NULL),(17,'A brush with death',' A near accidental encounter with death; an incident in which one comes very close to dying. “While crossing the street in Bangkok, yesterday, I had a close brush with death, when a speeding motorcyclist swerved barely in time to avoid hitting me head-on.” “The captain and crew of the submarine had a close brush with death, when a German torpedo, passed within half a meter of the port side of the hull.” “When I was mountain-climbing, I once had a brush with death, when I lost my footing and fell about forty-five meters straight down through the air and was only saved by my safety harness.” ',NULL),(18,'A bum-steer',' Purposely give someone the wrong directions on how to get somewhere or how to do something; give incorrect or wrong information to lead someone on a false trail; to mislead someone by giving bad advice. “Because country folks, in Tennessee, don’t like city-slickers, they often give them a bum-steer if they stop their cars to ask for directions.” “We were afraid the other rally team would reach the destination before us, so we purposely misled then with a bum-steer to throw them off-track for a while.” “My stock broker foolishly gave me a bum-steer on some risky stocks that declined dramatically in market value.” ',NULL),(19,'A bundle of energy',' A person who is packed-full of power and energy. “President Kennedy was seen by many as a youthful bundle of energy who was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the cause of equal rights and employed all his spiritual and physical strength to fight for the cause of  democracy.” “My little sister is a bundle of energy who does everything she can to make sure the get the job gets done. “My Campaign manager, Mary Hines, has been a real bundle of energy, the moving force behind our political success.” ',NULL),(20,'A bundle of nerves',' A person who is very stressed and jumpy. “I have been under so much pressure in the office and at home recently that I am little more than a bundle of nerves.” “Continued stress can turn you into a bundle of nerves.” “Before I have to give a presentation or speech, I am always a bundle of nerves.” ',NULL),(21,'A case in point',' An actual example to illustrate; a factual act which illustrates the point; an instance used to prove or explain a point. “There have been many female figures in the political world that have helped unite divergent factions. A case in point would be Sonya Gandhi.” “Multi-national mergers can be beneficial to both sides. A case in point was the merger of KPMG with Arthur Andersen which brought benefits to both sides.” “Sometimes a son can follow in his father’s footsteps right up into the highest level of political office. A case in point would be George Bush Jr. holding the same post as George Bush Sr.” ',NULL),(22,'A case of the dropsy',' When a person keeps dropping things, letting things slip and fall from his fingers, we say he has a case of the dropsy. “I keep dropping dishes on the kitchen floor. I’ve got a case of the dropsy.” “Oops! I dropped my key again. I’ve got a case of the dropsy.” “Because Grandfather has poor blood circulation and limited feeling in the ends of his fingers, he keeps dropping things; it’s a classic example of the dropsy.” ',NULL),(23,' A cipher','  An insignificant person; someone not even worthy of notice; a nothing and a no body. “You are a person of no account. No one cares in the least about you, because you are just a cipher!” “Sometimes, within the structure of our company, I feel like nothing more than an insignificant statistic on a broad spread-sheet. I feel like such a cipher.” “Her first husband was a real cipher; he was about as significant as a fly speck on the wall.” ',NULL),(24,'A clean break',' A clear and final breaking-off of relations; finally finishing and leaving for good. “I want to leave the company and make a clean break with the audit profession because I find it too stressful for me.” “My wife and I have decided to make a clean break, and go our own separate ways.” “When I retired as a military man, I decided to make a clean break with the past and to devote myself to peace and charity.” ',NULL),(25,'A clean slate',' Starting off with a clean record. i.e. after having confessed your wrong-doings and served your punishment.  “My teacher says that once I have served my punishment for cheating, I will have erased my bad record and I can start off with a clean slate.” “Now that I have served my prison sentence, I can start off with a clean slate and start a new and better life.” “Once a murder has done his time and paid his debt to society, he is released from prison with a clean slate and allowed to rejoin society.” ',NULL),(26,'A clip over the ear',' A slap on the side of the head; a smack on the ear; a box on the ear. “My son, if you don’t stop that noise I’ll give you a clip over the ear.” “Father says that if he ever catches me lying, he’ll give me a clip over the ear.” “I’ll give you a good clip over the ear if I ever hear you saying anything nasty like that again.” ',NULL),(27,'A close call',' A narrow escape; a close shave; a brush with danger, nearly missing death. “The pilot landed his plane on the runway, just as it was running out of fuel. It was quite a close call.” “The bomb squad disarmed the explosive device just a few seconds before it was about to go off. It was a very close call.” “The farmer was rescue-lifted by helicopter from the rooftop of his barn just as the nearby dam was about to burst. It was a close call.” ',NULL),(28,'A close shave',' A close call; brush with danger; a near accident. “My cousin, Clem, threw a hunting knife at me that whizzed so close by me under my ear that it nearly cut the whiskers from my cheek. That was a close shave.” “The enemy shot a missile at the plane which whistled by within inches of the fuselage, as the pilot was starting to loop to avoid impact. That was certainly a close shave, if there ever was one.” “Last night, in the warehouse, I had a close shave with death, when the crane operator dropped a container that hit the ground in just in front of me.” ',NULL),(29,'A crushing blow',' A hurtful action; a disappointing defeat; a strong setback. “When my wife packed-up and left me, it was a crushing blow.” “It was a crushing blow when I lost my job during the financial crisis.” “It was a crushing blow for the Conservative Party when the Liberals won the election.” ',NULL),(30,'A crying-shame',' A pity; a disgrace; something unfair that makes us feel sorry for the victimized. “It’s a crying-shame so many children are dying of malnutrition throughout the world, while the rest of us become fat and overweight.” “It’s a crying shame the way a small minority is getting rich on corruption, while the majority of the poor don’t have a the chance to earn a decent living.” “It’s a crying-shame the way Malone spends all his time and money drinking in the pub while making no effort to take care of his wife and children.” ',NULL),(31,'A cushy job',' An easy job that is not demanding or difficult; a comfortable, enjoyable job that does not take too much effort.  “The managing director has given his mistress a nice, cushy job in his office, and the rest of the staff members are feeling resentful” “My best friend has got a nice, cushy job in an air-conditioned office, while I have to work really hard, out in the heat of the day as a gardener.” “I wish I could get a nice cushy job where I wouldn’t have too much to do and not very much responsibility” ',NULL),(32,'A cut above the average',' Better than most; higher than normal; quite good compared to normal standards. “The new, young, foreign graduates that we have been hiring are a cut above average because they have been trained in a more up-to-date educational system.” “Our work for the client must be a cut above average if we want to stay competitive in the market.” “Your son, Stan, is certainly a cut above average when compared to the rest of the students in class.” ',NULL),(33,'A drop in the bucket',' A small part of the whole; very little compared to the total amount; a small fraction of the total sum “The amount the government is investing in environmental research is a drop in the bucket compared to what it spends on national defense.” “Government aid of a million dollars for Tsunami refugees is just a drop in the bucket in contrast to the huge amount that foreign non-government agencies are presently spending.” “The money I lost on gambling in Los Vegas is just a drop in the bucket compared to the massive amount of income taxes I have to pay every year.” ',NULL),(34,'A drop in the ocean',' Just a small amount compared to the size of the whole; only a little bit of the total quantity. “A million dollars is a drop in the ocean compared to the total amount needed to combat starvation and hunger in the Sudan.” “The little bit he gives to charity is just a drop in the ocean compared to money he wastes on drink and women.” “What the company spends on staff development is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it spends on developing the company image.” ',NULL),(35,'A dud',' Just as a bomb that has been dropped may fail to explode due to a faulty triggering-device, so a plan, or performance may lack the necessary spark to fire the imagination of the public. “The fireworks extravaganza was a disastrous disappointment, because the ignition devices didn’t go off in sequence, so the whole show was a dud.” “The high school opening performance of a Shakespeare’s play, Macbeth, failed to awaken the imagination of the student body. It was a real and total dud” “Even the most expensive film ever made by Hollywood would be a gigantic dud, if it didn’t feature big-name stars and a have a huge promotion budget.” *',NULL),(36,'A fair crack at',' A chance to try your luck; an opportunity to fix or solve a problem; an opening or possibility to show how well you can do. “I know I could be a good movie actress if I were given a fair crack at it.” “If I were given a fair crack at solving the traffic problem, I’d have it fixed within three months.” “If I am given the chance of becoming the company managing director, I’m sure I’d be a success. All I need is a fair crack at it.” ',NULL),(37,'A fat lot of good that will do',' That won’t help much; won’t make matters better; won’t do any good; won’t improve the situation. “You can invest another million in your business, but a fat lot of good that will do, if your cost of investment continues to exceed profits from sales.” “You can fill the tank of the car with gas, but a fat lot of good that will do if you don’t get the fuel pump fixed as well.” “You may have a good business plan, but a fat lot of good that will do if you can’t find the cash for the start-up costs.” ',NULL),(38,'A fat lot you care!',' Indicates you know that the other person has no sympathy or understanding for you. “I’m falling apart emotionally because I’m disappointed about our love, but a fat lot you care!” “Your hate and greed have driven me to destruction, but a fat lot you care!” “I’ve never been through such terrible suffering in my life, but I can see you have absolutely no pity for me. A fat lot you care!” ',NULL),(39,'A fate worse than death',' Suffering that is so bad that dying would be easier or maybe better. “Being in a state of insufferable pain for months and months is a fate worse than death itself.” “Loving someone who is burning with hatred towards you can be compared with a fate worse than death” “It’s possible to argue that there is no fate worse than death, but being married to my wife would surely put you to the test.” ',NULL),(40,'A feather in your cap',' Just as in the old days when hunters wore a fine-looking feather, stuck into the band of their caps, as a sign of their hunting skill, so, nowadays, we can say someone deserves a feather in his cap when he has done something well or worthy of recognition. “You deserve a feather in your cap for all the time you have devoted to community service.” “Collins deserves a feather in his cap for solving the math problem in half the time it took the others.” “Winning a Nobel Prize is the highest modern-dayequivalent of wearing a feather in your cap.” ',NULL),(41,'A feeding-frenzy',' Just as man-eating piranha fish will swarm to a chunk of flesh, which is thrown into the water, and have a feeding frenzy, so “mass media reporters, for example, can swarm to the scene a and have a ‘feeding frenzy’ wherever a big star is involved in a public scandal.” “The press had a feeding frenzy when the big Tsunami hit  South East Asia, killing in excess of forty thousand victims.” “It is despicable the way that the press can create a feeding frenzy when disaster strikes, because the viewing audience is hungry for information.” ',NULL),(42,'A fine kettle of fish',' Just as a pot of fish will begin to stink if it stands for too long, so a problem that is neglected too long will be hard to fix; a mistake hard to remedy; a situation that is hard to get out of. “This is a fine kettle of fish. Our daughter is pregnant, her boyfriend is in jail, and nobody quite knows what to do.” “Now you have got yourself into a fine kettle of fish. You’ve been caught cheating just before graduation and there’s no excuse.” “It’s a fine kettle of fish. You need one million for bail and all your accounts have been frozen, so it’s a dilemma that cannot be resolved.” ',NULL),(43,'A fine state of affairs!',' A big problem; a situation that is hard to resolve; a set of conditions that have been allowed to arise but cannot so easily be made to cease. “This is a fine state of affairs! What are we going to say to your father when he finds out that you are in love with a married-man?” “This is a fine state of affairs! How could you allow your finances to get into such a terrible mess?” “This is a fine state of affairs. Your father did not leave a last will and testament and the family will be fighting over his assets for years to come.” ',NULL),(44,'A fly in the ointment',' Just as there can be a fly in the ointment or balm used as a medicine, so there can be a problem in what is seen as the solution. “When there is a fly in the ointment, we may still have to use it to treat the disease, but we don’t feel perfectly happy with the cure.” “Well, we’ve found a solution regarding the transfer of funds, but there’s a fly in the ointment because there will be a tax increase of five percent.” “I got them to comply with the late payment agreement but there is a fly in the ointment because the agreement must be renegotiated before the next payment period.” ',NULL),(45,'A freak of nature',' Something that happens that does not follow the usual pattern of nature. “A man born with one eye in the middle of his forehead is a freak of nature.” “It is hard to determine if someone born with mixed male and female body parts is a freak of nature.” “Even if a Tsunami tidal wave arises only once in a thousand years, it is not a freak occurrence. It is not a freak of nature because it happens in accordance with the laws of nature.” ',NULL),(46,'A free bit of advice',' A suggestion given that isn’t requested; an unsolicitedopinion. “Let me give you a free bit of advice. ‘Next time you want to open your mouth, remember that the teeth are at home when the mouth is closed.’” “Because I am  older, let me give you a bit of free advice: ‘No older person ever gave any younger person any piece of useful advice’.” “I’ll give you a bit of free advice, ‘If you want to stay out of trouble, don’t go around giving people bits free advice.” ',NULL),(47,'A frog in your throat',' Laryngitis; a physical condition that makes your voice sound deeper, as though you had a frog in your throat; or when you have a bad cold that makes your voice sounds like a low, hoarse croak. “Sorry, if you can’t hear me in the back. I’ve got a frog in my throat and I cannot speak any more loudly.” “Mr. Peters cannot speak to you now. He’s got a frog in his throat, and has to rest his voice for the speech he has got to give this evening.” “I’ve got tonsillitis and it makes me sound like I’ve got a frog in my throat.” ',NULL),(48,'A funny feeling',' A strange sense that something is wrong; a suspicion that something bad is going to happen. “When he asked me to come to his room to look at some pictures, I had a funny feeling that something was wrong.” “When my boss called me and asked me to come to his office, I had the funny feeling that I had done something wrong.” “When the four gangsters asked me to get into their car to go and talk to their boss, I had a funny feeling I might never come back alive.” ',NULL),(49,'A good egg',' Just as we can speak of a person who is a rotten egg, who can spoil a whole basket, so we may say someone else is a good egg, meaning that he does no harm and fits in well for the sake of the general good. “You’ll like my Uncle Bob. He’s a good egg and is well-loved by everyone in the family.” “My boss is really a good egg and everyone likes working with him.” “Our Uncle Charlie is really a good egg and is always doing things to help other people.” * A good omen  A good sign that something good or something better is going to happen. “When the rainy season begins with heavy showers, this is a good omen that the rice harvest will be good that year.” “I always think it’s a good omen when there are two full moons in one monthly cycle; that is a sign of good luck.” “I think it is a good omen that there have been fewer and fewer terrorist attacks in the South in the last few months.” ',NULL),(50,'A greenhorn',' Someone with little or no experience; a novice; a beginner; a person who comes in with no idea of what to do and has to learn to cope quickly. “When I first joined the circus, I was a total greenhorn and not much good for anything but, bit-by-bit; I learned a few tricks and was then able to take part in the performances.” “A new recruit in the navy comes as a greenhorn and has to learn  the ropes, but, after twenty years before the mast, he is considered an old hand.” “When I first came to the Wild West from the city of Boston, at the age of sixteen, people teased me and called me a greenhorn, but I eventually got the hang of things, and, later became an experienced cowboy.” ',NULL),(51,'A gut feeling',' A natural instinct or intuition that tells you when something is going to go wrong. “I have a gut feeling that you are lying to me.” “People sometimes have a gut feeling that tells them not to trust somebody.” “A gut feeling is something like a sixth sense of awareness that is located in your stomach rather than your head.” ',NULL),(52,'A hard nut to crack',' A difficult, inflexible person who is hard to convince or win over to your way of thinking or seeing things. “Roger is so stubborn that it will be almost impossible to get him to agree.

This is how you catch a fish.\n2:19\nSokka, look!\n2:20\nShhh~ Katara, you\'re gonna scare it away.\n2:24\nMmmm, I can already smell it cookin\'!\n2:27\nBut Sokka! I caught one!\n2:32\nHey!\n2:32\nUgh!\n2:34\nWhy is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?\n2:39\nAh~ It\'s not magic. It\'s waterbending, and it\'s...\n2:43\nYeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah...\n2:47\nLook, I\'m just saying that if I had weird powers, I\'d keep my weirdness to myself.\n2:51\nYou\'re calling me weird?\n2:53\nI\'m not the one who makes muscles at myself...\n2:55\n...everytime I see my reflection in the water.\n3:14\nWatch out!\n3:17\nGo left! Go left!\n3:31\nYou call that left?\n3:32\nYou don\'t like my steering.\n3:33\nWell, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.\n3:37\nSo it\'s my fault?\n3:38\nI knew I should have left you home.\n3:40\nLeave it to a girl to screw things up.\n3:44\nYou are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...\n3:49\n...ugh, I\'m embarrassed to be related to you!\n3:54\nEver since Mom died I\'ve been doing all the work around camp...\n3:57\n...while you\'ve been off playing soldier!\n3:59\nUh... Katara?\n4:01\nI even wash all the clothes!\n4:03\nHave you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!!\n4:08\nKatara! Settle down!\n4:10\nNo, that\'s it. I\'m done helping you.\n4:13\nFrom now on, you\'re on your own!\n4:30\nOkay, you\'ve gone from weird to freakish, Katara.\n4:32\nYou mean I did that?\n4:34\nYup. Congratulations.\n5:09\nHe\'s alive! We have to help.\n5:12\nKatara! Get back here! We don\'t know what that thing is!\n5:50\nFinally. Uncle, do you realize what this means?\n5:54\nI won\'t get to finish my game?\n5:56\nIt means my search. It\'s about to come to an end.\n6:02\nThat light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him!\n6:06\nOr it\'s just the celestial lights. We\'ve been down this road before, Prince Zuko.\n6:13\nI don\'t want you to get too excited over nothing.\n6:17\nPlease, sit. Why don\'t you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?\n6:24\nI don\'t need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar.\n6:28\nHelmsman, head a course for the light!\n6:50\nStop!\n7:07\nStop it!\n7:19\nI need to ask you something.\n7:22\nWhat?\n7:23\nPlease... come closer.\n7:26\nWhat is it?\n7:28\nWill you go penguin sledding with me?\n7:31\nUh... sure. I guess.\n7:36\nWhat\'s going on here?\n7:37\nYou tell us!\n7:38\nHow\'d you get in the ice? And why aren\'t you frozen?\n7:41\nI\'m not sure.\n7:50\nAppa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.\n8:04\nHaha! You\'re okay!\n8:13\nWhat is that thing?\n8:14\nThis is Appa, my flying bison.\n8:16\nRight. And this is Katara, my flying sister.\n8:31\nDon\'t worry. It\'ll wash out.\n8:36\nSo, do you guys live around here?\n8:37\nDon\'t answer that!\n8:39\nDid you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.\n8:42\nOh, yeah, I\'m sure he\'s a spy for the Fire Navy.\n8:45\nYou can tell by that evil look in his eye.\n8:50\nThe paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.\n8:54\nI\'m A...\n9:09\nI\'m Aang.\n9:12\nYou just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.\n9:15\nReally? It felt higher that that.\n9:17\nAh, you\'re an airbender!\n9:19\nSure am.\n9:20\nGiant light beams... flying bison... airbenders...\n9:23\nI think I\'ve got Midnight Sun Madness.\n9:25\nI\'m going home to where stuff makes sense.\n9:32\nWell, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.\n9:39\nWe\'d love a ride! Thanks!\n9:40\nOh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.\n9:44\nAre you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?\n9:48\nYou know... before you freeze to death?\n9:56\nOkay. First time flyers, hold on tight!\n9:59\nAppa, yip yip!\n10:10\nCome on, Appa. Yip yip.\n10:12\nWow. That was truly amazing.\n10:16\nAppa\'s just tired. A little rest and he\'ll be soaring through the sky. You\'ll see.\n10:24\nWhy are you smiling at me like that?\n10:26\nOh... I was smiling?\n10:44\nI\'m going to bed now.\n10:49\nYep. A man needs his rest.\n10:53\nPrince Zuko, you need some sleep.\n10:57\nEven if you\'re right and the Avatar is alive, you won\'t find him.\n11:03\nYour father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.\n11:10\nBecause their honor didn\'t hinge on the Avatar\'s capture. Mine does.\n11:15\nThis coward\'s hundred years in hiding are over.\n11:29\nHey.\n11:31\nHey. Whatcha thinkin\' about?\n11:33\nI guess I was wondering...\n11:35\n...your being an airbender and all... if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.\n11:40\nUhh... no. I didn\'t know him... I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn\'t. Sorry.\n11:47\nOkay. Just curious. Goodnight.\n11:50\nSleep tight.\n12:37\nAang! Aang, wake up!\n12:40\nIt\'s okay. We\'re in the village now. Come on, get ready. Everyone\'s waiting to meet you.\n13:00\nAang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.\n13:08\nUh... why are they all looking at me like that?\n13:12\nDid Appa sneeze on me?\n13:14\nWell, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years.\n13:17\nWe thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.\n13:22\nExtinct\'?\n13:23\nAang, this is my grandmother.\n13:25\nCall me Gran Gran.\n13:28\nWhat is this, a weapon? You can\'t stab anything with this.\n13:32\nIt\'s not for stabbing. It\'s for airbending.\n13:37\nMagic trick! Do it again!\n13:39\nNot magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.\n13:45\nYou know, last time I checked, humans can\'t fly.\n13:48\nCheck again!\n13:52\nWhoa... it\'s flying...\n13:58\n...it\'s amazing!\n14:12\nOh, my watchtower!\n14:17\nThat was amazing.\n14:25\nGreat. You\'re an airbender,...\n14:27\n...Katara\'s a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.\n14:31\nYou\'re a waterbender!\n14:32\nWell... sort of. Not yet.\n14:35\nAll right. No more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.\n14:39\nI told you! He\'s the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me.\n14:44\nKatara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.\n14:48\nBut he\'s special. I can tell.\n14:51\nI sense he\'s filled with much wisdom.\n14:54\nSthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.\n15:05\nAgain.\n15:12\nNo! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles.\n15:18\nThe breath becomes energy in the body.\n15:22\nThe energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.\n15:27\nGet it right this time.\n15:29\nEnough. I\'ve been drilling this sequence all day.\n15:32\nTeach me the next set. I\'m more than ready.\n15:34\nNo, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics.\n15:39\nDrill it again!\n15:45\nThe sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.\n15:49\nHe must be over a hundred years old by now.\n15:51\nHe\'s had a century to master the four elements.\n15:54\nI\'ll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.\n15:57\nYou will teach me the advanced set!\n16:02\nVery well. But first I must finish my roast duck.\n16:11\nNow men, it\'s important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.\n16:15\nIn the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.\n16:18\nFor without courage, how can we call ourselves men?\n16:25\nI gotta pee!\n16:26\nListen! Until your fathers return from the war,...\n16:29\n...they\'re counting on you to be the men of this tribe.\n16:31\nAnd that means no potty breaks.\n16:34\nBut I really gotta go.\n16:36\nUgh... okay... who else has to go?\n16:44\nHave you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.\n16:48\nWow! Everything freezes in there!\n16:52\nUgh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.\n17:03\nStop! Stop it right now!\n17:05\nWhat\'s wrong with you? We don\'t have time for fun and games with a war going on.\n17:10\nWhat war? What are you talking about?\n17:13\nYou\'re kidding, right?\n17:15\nPenguin!\n17:23\nHe\'s kidding, right?\n17:31\nAang?\n17:34\nHey, come on little guy.\n17:35\nWanna go sledding?\n17:40\nHeh heh, I have a way with animals.\n17:46\nAang, I\'ll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.\n17:52\nYou got a deal! Just one little problem. I\'m an airbender, not a waterbender.\n17:58\nIsn\'t there someone in your tribe who can teach you?\n18:00\nNo. You\'re looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.\n18:05\nThis isn\'t right. A waterbender needs to master water.\n18:10\nWhat about the North Pole? There\'s another Water Tribe up there, right?\n18:14\nMaybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.\n18:16\nMaybe. But we haven\'t had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.\n18:21\nIt\'s not exactly... turn right at the second glacier.\' It\'s on the other side of the world.\n18:25\nBut you forget, I have a flying bison.\n18:28\nAppa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole.\n18:31\nKatara, we\'re gonna find you a master!\n18:34\nThat\'s... I mean, I don\'t know.\n18:37\nI\'ve never left home before.\n18:39\nWell, you think about it.\n18:41\nBut in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?\n18:45\nOkay, listen closely my young pupil.\n18:48\nCatching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe.\n19:21\nI haven\'t done this since I was a kid!\n19:23\nYou still are a kid!\n19:47\nWhoa... what is that?\n19:50\nA Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.\n19:58\nAang, stop! We\'re not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped.\n20:03\nIf you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.\n20:53\nThis ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.\n20:57\nIt was part of the Fire Nation\'s first attacks.\n21:00\nOkay, back up.\n21:02\nI have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I\'ve never seen any war.\n21:07\nAang, how long were you in that iceberg?\n21:10\nI don\'t know... a few days, maybe?\n21:12\nI think it was more like a hundred years!\n21:16\nWhat? That\'s impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?\n21:20\nThink about it. The war is a century old. You don\'t know about it because...\n21:25\n...somehow, you were in there that whole time. It\'s the only explanation.\n21:33\nA hundred years! I can\'t believe it.\n21:36\nI\'m sorry, Aang.

from another\n0:01\nmother my rational sisters from another\n0:03\nmister\n0:03\nit\'s your pops from another block you\n0:05\nguys got some funny names for me in the\n0:06\ncomments these days i got to tell you\n0:08\nuh today\'s video i\'m going to be giving\n0:10\nyou five things\n0:11\nthat um most guys don\'t know um\n0:14\nsome women don\'t even know themselves\n0:16\nand a lot of women don\'t want guys to\n0:18\nknow\n0:18\nso these are these are some distilled\n0:21\nnotes that i\'ve taken from a lot of the\n0:22\ncoaching calls that i\'ve done with you\n0:24\nguys over the phone on clarity for\n0:25\npeople that were stuck on\n0:27\nthings in business and relationship and\n0:28\nlife and divorce and stuff like that\n0:30\nso i want to i want to give this back to\n0:31\nyou guys to help you understand a little\n0:33\nbit more\n0:34\num you know female nature feminine\n0:35\nimperative inter-gender relationships\n0:37\nthat sort of stuff\n0:38\nfirst disclaimer i want to say is yes\n0:40\nladies i know\n0:41\nnot all women are like that and there\n0:42\nare some unicorns out there but on\n0:44\nthe balance of probabilities uh these\n0:47\nfive rules apply to just about everybody\n0:49\nso\n0:49\nlet\'s uh let\'s dive right into this\n0:51\nnumber one uh monkey branching\n0:53\nsome of you guys already know what this\n0:54\nis let me just clarify for those that\n0:56\nare new\n0:56\nmonkey branching is everybody knows what\n0:58\na monkey does when it you know branches\n1:00\nfrom one tree to the other tree and\n1:01\nit\'ll let go of one and go to the other\n1:03\num women are uh known or unknown monkey\n1:07\nbranches some guys have\n1:08\nactually believed that um there\'s a\n1:10\ngrace period or waiting period of i\n1:12\ndon\'t know a month or a week\n1:14\nbut the truth of the matter is women can\n1:16\nmonkey branch and often do quite a bit\n1:17\nfaster than that\n1:18\nusually um you know within the next day\n1:21\nor sometimes\n1:21\nwithin the same day um i\'ve done some\n1:24\ncoaching calls with some guys where\n1:26\nthey walk around almost sleepwalking\n1:27\nlike they don\'t even have their eyes\n1:29\nopen\n1:30\nand a woman has uh ended a long-term\n1:32\nrelationship ghosted but then they try\n1:34\nto keep them at orange length like the\n1:36\nljbf let\'s just be friends sort of\n1:38\nroutine\n1:39\nbecause they want that guy as a backup\n1:41\nbut the truth of the matter is when\n1:43\nthat happens it happens a lot sooner\n1:45\nthan what guys think\n1:46\nand it also happens a lot sooner than\n1:49\nwomen want guys to think\n1:50\nthe reason for that is well number one\n1:54\nis slut-shaming you know women women\n1:55\ntend to get slut-shamed if they behave\n1:57\nin a promiscuous fashion\n1:58\ni totally get it um but it\'s also\n2:01\ngenetically programmed into them you\n2:02\nknow for a very long time women\n2:04\num have have been threatened and and\n2:06\nstill to this day within the world i\n2:08\nmean there\'s women that that\'ll get\n2:09\nstoned to death for\n2:10\ngetting raped by somebody so um they\n2:12\njust want to protect themselves\n2:14\nuh that\'s generally why they do it so\n2:16\nthat\'s number one monkey branching\n2:18\nnumber two uh hypergamy does not give a\n2:21\nabout relationship\n2:23\nequity i\'ve used this word before\n2:25\nhypergamy hypergamy pronounce it any way\n2:27\nyou want\n2:28\nwhat it is is women tend to move up when\n2:31\nit comes to\n2:32\nrelationship goals marrying stuff like\n2:34\nthat they don\'t tend to date down\n2:35\nthere\'s always a line in the sand\n2:37\nuh they don\'t date below them themselves\n2:39\neconomically or more often not\n2:41\nthey always tend to go up so a lot of\n2:44\nguys tend to believe\n2:45\nand this still blows me away every time\n2:47\ni coach somebody on this\n2:49\non the phone but guys still tend to\n2:51\nbelieve that if they put in the work\n2:53\nthen they\'ve got this um interesting\n2:56\nconcept of like this universal bank\n2:58\naccount where they can make deposits and\n3:00\nwithdrawals\n3:00\nit\'s almost like you know i did this i\n3:02\ndid that i hung up that for you i did\n3:04\nthis with the kids\n3:05\nor your kids if they\'re dating a single\n3:07\nmom or something like that i fixed this\n3:09\ni did that with your car\n3:10\nyou know it\'s like they do these things\n3:12\nand they believe they\'ve got\n3:13\nrelationship equity that they can make a\n3:15\nwithdrawal on\n3:16\nat a later date like it almost creates\n3:19\nan extra level of security for them\n3:22\nin that relationship but the truth of\n3:24\nthe matter is and if you haven\'t read\n3:25\nthe rational mail i always have the link\n3:27\nbelow in the description of every one of\n3:29\nmy videos and i almost always mention it\n3:30\ngrab the book if you haven\'t read it\n3:33\nbut hypergamy just does not give a\n3:35\nabout relationship equity\n3:37\nyou could bend over backwards and do\n3:39\neverything for a woman under the sun\n3:41\nif she has the opportunity to monkey\n3:44\nbranch up to a better deal and\n3:46\nyou\'re not serving her needs anymore or\n3:48\nthere\'s a better opportunity that will\n3:50\nserve her needs or the needs of her\n3:51\nchildren for example if she\'s a single\n3:52\nmother\n3:53\nshe will monkey branch up to the other\n3:55\ndude so don\'t think for a minute that\n3:57\nuh bending over backwards will create\n3:59\nthis you know deposit withdrawal system\n4:01\nfor you\n4:02\nit doesn\'t exist okay number three\n4:05\nuh women tend to spin more plates than\n4:07\nguys do\n4:08\num i\'ve mentioned plate spinning theory\n4:11\nbefore also mentioned in the rational\n4:13\nmail by rolo tomasi\n4:14\num plate spinning theory is pretty\n4:16\nstraightforward it\'s it\'s it\'s when you\n4:18\ndate non-exclusively meaning\n4:20\num you\'ve got you know more than two\n4:23\npeople\n4:23\nthat you\'re dating at the same time two\n4:25\nor more let\'s say\n4:27\ni know that guys tend to get a lot of\n4:28\nheat for being the dogs and dating\n4:30\nmultiple women\n4:31\nand stuff like that but uh again because\n4:33\nof things like\n4:34\nshaming and the way that women are\n4:36\nare treated throughout the world and\n4:38\nit\'s known that they have that risk and\n4:40\nexposure\n4:41\nthey tend to keep their uh dating\n4:43\nactivity on the down low\n4:44\nthey\'ll talk about it with their\n4:45\ngirlfriends luckily i\'ve got some very\n4:49\nclose\n4:49\nuh female friends that have opened up on\n4:52\nthis\n4:53\nand i\'ve also coached some women in this\n4:55\narea as well that have been dealing with\n4:56\nrelationship issues that they\'ve been in\n4:58\nbut um i\'ll give you a very good example\n5:01\na woman that i had dated at one point um\n5:04\nshe was she was open about the concept\n5:06\nof\n5:06\nuh dating other people open open type of\n5:08\nrelationship or even by curious\n5:10\nby sort of thing and i had her phone\n5:12\nshe\'s like read this\n5:13\nshe walked away i closed the phone and\n5:16\nas i closed the app that i was on\n5:18\num i was left in the text message menu\n5:21\nand in the text message menu\n5:23\ni saw all these names with these\n5:25\ndescriptions after so typically when\n5:27\nyou\'re when you\'re dating\n5:28\nit\'s like you know richard entrepreneur\n5:30\ndave accountant\n5:32\nuh chris contractor uh you know\n5:35\nphillip uh lawyer you know sort of thing\n5:38\nso they\n5:39\nthey they tend to not always put the\n5:41\nlast name of the person or enter that\n5:43\nway in their phone and there was this\n5:44\nlist of like\n5:45\ni don\'t know like seven or eight\n5:47\ndifferent names on there um\n5:48\nyou\'ve got to understand that women\n5:50\naren\'t going to publicly declare\n5:52\nto you that they\'ve got uh plates\n5:53\nspinning multiple plates spinning\n5:55\nbut they tend to spin as many plates if\n5:57\nnot more\n5:58\nthan men that\'s been my experience and\n5:59\nwhat i\'ve come across all right let\'s\n6:01\nmove on to the next one\n6:02\nuh what are we on so women get bored\n6:05\nfaster than\n6:06\nmen that\'s number four women get bored\n6:08\nfaster than men when it comes to\n6:09\nrelationships\n6:10\nuh esther perel wrote a fascinating book\n6:12\ncalled uh\n6:13\nmating in captivity uh i\'ll grab a link\n6:16\nand put that before\n6:17\nbelow as well i\'m gonna recommend that\n6:19\nto you as well the books pretty slow up\n6:21\nuntil about chapter 10 and 11\n6:23\nuh and then 11 and 12 it gets really\n6:25\ninteresting for you guys\n6:26\nbut one of the things she talks about in\n6:28\nher i think it\'s\n6:29\nbeen a 40-year career uh dealing with\n6:32\nmen and women in relationship\n6:34\nissues and things that they\'ve been\n6:34\nstuck on and counseling through divorce\n6:37\nuh and um indiscretions and so on and so\n6:40\nforth\n6:40\nuh was that she\'s noted that um desire\n6:43\nin men tends to\n6:44\ngradually decrease over a longer period\n6:47\nof time\n6:47\nand desire in women tanks as soon as\n6:50\nyou\'re in a long-term relationship or\n6:52\nshortly thereafter very very quickly\n6:54\nthat\'s why um\n6:55\nyou know when people get married and\n6:58\nthey\'ve been in a marriage for you know\n6:59\nfour or five years\n7:00\nthe guy tends to be okay with things\n7:02\neven if they\'re not the greatest\n7:03\nand women are not because their desire\n7:05\nand the other guy is tanked a lot\n7:07\nquicker\n7:07\nwhich is really why women initiate\n7:09\nsomething like 70 or 80 percent of the\n7:11\ndivorces just because they get fed up\n7:12\nwith what they\'re doing\n7:13\nand their desire tank so you just have\n7:14\nto be aware of that i\'m going to leave\n7:16\nthat at number four\n7:17\nand guys i do want to hear your comments\n7:19\nand all of these things below ladies and\n7:21\ngentlemen let me know what your thoughts\n7:22\nare and add it to the community\n7:23\nalso experiences are very good too i\n7:25\nlove reading those number five\n7:28\nwomen cheat as much as men do but\n7:32\nmostly when they\'re ovulating so i\'m\n7:34\ngonna i\'m gonna open that one up\n7:36\nfor a little bit more discussion you\n7:38\nknow women are always going on about how\n7:40\nguys cheat all the time\n7:41\nbut they\'re not honest about their\n7:44\nsexual activity with\n7:45\nguys again of course because of things\n7:46\nlike shaming and how women\n7:48\nare treated in society uh you know as a\n7:51\nfair sex so on and so forth\n7:52\nbut um we\'ve got to be open and honest\n7:55\nabout this sort of thing because it does\n7:57\nhappen uh just as much because how do\n7:59\nyou have a guy\n8:00\nand a girl you know have a one-night\n8:02\nstand but you know there\'s no\n8:03\ndeclaration of\n8:04\nyou know women doing the exact same\n8:06\nthings that guys do guys aren\'t having\n8:07\none-night stands with themselves they\'re\n8:09\nnot masturbating that\'s not a one-night\n8:10\nstand\n8:10\nokay or they\'re not having it with\n8:12\nanother dude when they\'re talking about\n8:13\nthese one-night stands\n8:14\nuh it\'s with uh women and this cheating\n8:17\nyou know phenomenon happens\n8:19\nat the same rate between men and women\n8:22\nit\'s identical now the interesting thing\n8:23\nabout it when it comes to women and\n8:25\na lot of women don\'t even know this\n8:26\nthemselves is um\n8:28\nwhen they cheat or when they\'re more apt\n8:30\nto cheat or have these one night stands\n8:32\nis typically in that small window during\n8:34\nthe month when they\'re ovulating\n8:36\nsurprise surprise they\'re they\'re\n8:38\nlooking for the alpha okay\n8:40\ni\'m going to leave it at that in today\'s\n8:41\nvideo i appreciate

watching MarieTV, the place to be to create a business and life you love.\n0:13\nAnd I am so excited I can barely contain myself because today\'s guest is someone that I\'ve\n0:19\nadmired for so long. He\'s impacted tens of millions of lives all around the world and he\'s written an\n0:24\nincredible new book, which we\'re gonna talk about today. Tony Robbins is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, and philanthropist.\n0:32\nFor more than 37 years, millions of people have enjoyed the warmth, humor, and the transformational\n0:38\npower of Mr. Robbins\' business and personal development events. He\'s the nation\'s number one life and business strategist.\n0:45\nHe\'s called upon to consult and coach with some of the world\'s finest athletes, entertainers,\n0:50\nFortune 500 CEOs, and even presidents of nations. Robbins is a founder of or partner in more than a dozen companies in industries as diverse\n0:59\nas a five star island resort in Fiji to custom 3D printed prosthetic limbs.\n1:05\nThrough the Anthony Robbins foundation and his matching funds, Tony feeds four million\n1:10\npeople per year in 56 countries. He\'s also initiated programs in more than 1500 schools, 700 prisons, and 50 thousand\n1:19\nservice organizations and shelters. He lives in Palm Beach, Florida. Tony, it is so amazing to have you here.\n1:26\nThank you so much for making the time. Thanks for having me. So I think I told you this way back when you interviewed me for the new Money Masters.\n1:33\nYou know, I just wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart. When I was in my early 20s I went to Unleash the Power Within...\n1:39\nYes. ...and you made such an impact on me and it\'s influenced everything I\'ve done personally\n1:45\nand everything in my business. I just want you to hear, like, who you are, what you do, how you serve, it makes such\n1:51\na huge difference and it means the world to me to have you here today. Oh, that\'s so sweet. Thank you.\n1:56\nSo... Thank you for that. Let\'s get started because one of the things I admire so much about you is your energy\n2:02\nand your passion and your stamina. I mean, you\'ve been doing this for over 3 decades and I know everybody watching...\n2:09\nIt\'s getting closer to 4 now. Which is awesome. It\'s so incredible. Yeah.\n2:14\nAnd one of the things that I so admire is I feel like you keep getting better, you keep doing more, you keep serving on a higher level.\n2:22\nAnd from a personal just stamina standpoint, tell us a little bit about what you do every day.\n2:28\nWhat are your habits? How do you keep yourself at this high level of service? Well, I think there\'s the physical side of it, which, you know, I do the equivalent\n2:36\nof an ultra marathon every weekend. You know, I do 52 hours. On the last day I do 26.5 miles, the previous day is 22 miles.\n2:43\nSo just the physical side, you have to be in incredible shape. And I\'m in better shape physically today, both my endurance and my muscular strength\n2:50\nand so forth, then when I was 25, which is wonderful. And so I do certain things [inaudible] but I think I should mention first, what\'s even\n2:55\nmore important is the psychological, spiritual side of things because I think energy comes\n3:00\nfirst not from your body. It doesn\'t come from eating, it doesn\'t come from sleeping, because I\'ve gone without those things for long periods of time and still been able to deliver.\n3:07\nIt comes from having a mission. It comes from something that you\'re being pulled by, not something you\'re pushing on.\n3:13\nThere\'s two forms of motivation. You can push yourself to do things, and there\'s only so much you can push yourself to do. But if you\'re pulled, if there\'s something that you want to serve that\'s greater than\n3:21\nyourself, there\'s something that excites you, there\'s something that you\'re about, there\'s something you\'re made for, then there\'s a level of energy that most people\n3:26\nwould never dream of. And we all have that, but most of us don\'t connect to it and unleash it. So every day I connect and unleash that.\n3:33\nEvery single day. I don\'t hope it\'s gonna be there, even though I know it will be, even though it\'s there, I just... I don\'t take it for granted.\n3:39\nAnd so I start out my day by a process I do called priming. What priming is, it\'s not a meditation but it has meditative qualities.\n3:46\nAnd what I do is I sit down, first thing I do in the morning I go and I jump in the hot tub or a hot water type of experience and then I go to freezing water.\n3:53\nAll of my homes, fortunately I have to have multiple homes, that I go... one of them I have a river I get to jump in. You\'ve been there.\n3:58\nYeah. There are other places I have these cold plunges. And I do that to train my nervous system to go from 0 to 60 like that.\n4:05\nYou know, every muscle, every nerve in your body, every organ gets when you hit 57 degree water, it hits. And so it\'s just my mental discipline.\n4:11\nAnd the second thing I do is I prime, and priming is I sit down and I do a minimum of 10 minutes because my mindset is if you don\'t have 10 minutes, you don\'t have a life.\n4:20\nRight. So there\'s no excuse. So every day, sit down, and what do I do? I do three and a half minutes where I do an explosive breathing pattern, a pattern that\n4:26\nchanges my biochemistry, and after I\'ve done that, 30 of these intense breaths three times, I close my eyes, I\'m in kind of an altered state, and I focus first for 3 and\n4:35\na half minutes on just everything in my life, at least 3 things, that I\'m really truly grateful for.\n4:40\nAnd I don\'t do that in a hokey way, I don\'t do it in a mental way, I step into my body and I feel it.\n4:45\nAnd I make sure at least one of those things is something really simple: the wind against my skin, the look on my son\'s eyes or daughter\'s eyes, something that is just very fundamental,\n4:57\nbut I really... I cultivate that feeling of gratitude, of appreciation for those feelings.\n5:03\nI do it for three and a half minutes, then I do 3 and a half minutes where I do this process of focusing on healing, strengthening, and serving, and I start in a circle starting\n5:13\nwith myself and then I go through all the people in my life and associates and I just send love to them. Again, it may sound corny, but to me it\'s... it\'s a part of what I\'m here for and it\'s\n5:22\npart of cultivating that energy, that healing and strength energy, strengthening my passion, my appreciation, my insights, my...\n5:28\nmy capacity, my endurance. And then I do the last three minutes are what I call three to thrive, which is what is it\n5:34\nthat I really wanna make happen? And sometimes I do that over what I\'m gonna do for the next 6 months or month, sometimes\n5:40\nit\'s today. I shake it up. But I\'m... I see and feel and own that those things are done, and that starts, you know, pretty much\n5:47\nmy day between those two items. And, you know, then I might work out, some things that I do of that nature. Yeah. And how about eating wise?\n5:52\nHas that changed for you a lot over the years? It\'s... it\'s pretty simplistic. You know, I\'m very simple. I eat a salad and I have some protein.\n5:59\nI have fish or I\'ll have turkey bacon. I don\'t eat red meat or chicken, but those are the things that I have usually in the\n6:05\nmorning. And my afternoon, evening meals are pretty simple as well. But, you know, before I met my wife, Sage, the greatest gift in my life, when we first\n6:12\nmet, she\'s a phlebotomist and nutritionist and acupuncturist, so I thought, \"This is gonna be the easiest thing in the world.\"\n6:18\nAnd I\'ll never forget, we went out on this date and she had wheatgrass juice and I was like, \"Wow, this is gonna be so easy, man. This is awesome.\"\n6:23\nAnd then she ordered a hot fudge sundae and I was like, \"What in the hell are you doing?\" and she goes, \"Eating, you bastard.\"\n6:29\nI wish I could give some term around bastard, that I was like too rules driven. And so she had this whole thing, you zig and then you zag.\n6:37\nSo I do that with her now. I do enjoy other aspects of life, but when I first met her I noticed she zigged a lot\n6:42\nmore than she zagged, or the other way around. Which way it was. But it\'s been a nice balance in my life. So I enjoy food and things of that nature, but I use food mostly as fuel because life\n6:50\ngives me so much juice. You know, I\'m not looking to get out of food, usually. And how about, because I know for me my mind can go and I have so much excitement, so much\n6:59\npassion that at night sometimes winding down. Do you have a wind down process? My wife would say no.\n7:04\nI say yes, she would say no. My wife loves sleep. Yeah.\n7:10\nMy wife can sleep 8 hours, it\'s the most beautiful thing in the world. To me it\'s like sleep when you die, so that was one of the first things in our relationship\n7:16\nthat was a bit challenging. Because I\'d wanna get up and just go. I\'ll never forget, we were in Fiji and it was like even there we\'re supposed to be\n7:22\non vacation, it\'s our home, I jump up at 6 in the morning and she\'s like, \"Where the hell are you going?\" \"I\'ve gotta start my day, run up the mountain, do this.\"\n7:27\nShe goes, \"Get in bed, I\'ll show you how to start your day.\" Like, ok, now that\'s a better way to start my day. Totally. But now what I\'ve done is I get in bed with her because she\'s, you know, she\'s a lady.\n7:34\nIf you get up in the middle of the night, \"Where are you going?\" \"China. Where do you think I\'m going? It\'s three in the morning.\n7:39\nI\'m going to the bathroom.\" You know? So I\'ve learned to get my work done in bed beside her and then she goes to sleep. But I watch silly movies, I watch things to let my brain disappear.\n7:48\nReading does not slow me down because then I start incorporating and using it and my mind goes crazy. I\'m underlining everything.\n7:53\nBut I\'ll watch cartoon type movies like Family Guy or something to knock my brain out quite frankly, or I\'ll watch some silly series, you know, I\'m thinking now of the\n8:03\ndifferent ones. What is it? Revenge or something of that nature. Yeah, yeah. Something that my brain can just truly let go, and that\'s how I do it for the most\n8:10\npart. Awesome. So, I mean, you\'ve worked with presidents, you\'ve worked with people like Serena Williams,\n8:15\nand, you know, one of the greatest investors in the world, Paul Tudor Jones. When you\'re called in to work with these incredible folks, how do you start to prepare\n8:24\nyourself? Like, what are the questions that you ask to start to go in to serve at that level? Well, they\'re different for everybody, obviously, but what I try to do if I was trying to look\n8:32\nat it from a universal perspective, I guess what I really wanna know before I get there as much as I can is everything I can about the person.\n8:39\nAnd I do that because I really wanna know what do they want? What do they want in their life? What\'s their mission?\n8:44\nWhat are they after? And what do they fear? What are their concerns? Because I believe life is found in the dance between what you desire most and what you\n8:51\nfear most. And if I know those two edges of a person, I know a lot. And then I dig under and I try to learn as much as I can from other people about whatever\n8:58\nthe challenge may be, and then I go prepare to just learn from the person directly.\n9:03\nBut I wanna know as much as I can before I go in there. Then I take all that I think I know and then I see what\'s really real when I meet them.\n9:09\nAnd I\'m digging in to discover what... what\'s the challenge, what do they perceive it is. And usually, if I were to grossly generalize, if you\'re gonna help somebody create a breakthrough,\n9:19\nyou really... it all comes down to 3 areas. Either they\'ve altered their strategy. We all have strategies, a specific way of succeeding.\n9:26\nSometimes we alter it, whether it be in sports or whether it be in finance or any other area. We just... we forget something, we lose a little edge, we drop something out, and then\n9:34\nit becomes a bad habit. Or sometimes it\'s a change in our beliefs. Like, you know, you may have done something for decades and been really successful, but\n9:42\nnow... I know one gentleman, he\'s a good friend of mine, that, you know, had 52 Academy Award nominations and he said to me one day, he said, \"If I make one more frickin\' movie\n9:48\nI\'ll kill myself.\" You know? He\'s just like, \"I don\'t want to make a movie, I don\'t want an Academy Award, I don\'t want to do these things.\"\n9:54\nYou know? And it\'s just like he\'s satiated. And so sometimes when people get satiated they lose their hunger, they shift their beliefs.\n10:00\nWhen you change a belief, you change your biochemistry. When you change your belief, you change the way you execute. You change everything.\n10:05\nAnd we all develop a story. And sometimes stories are empowering and sometimes the mental stories are disempowering. So I\'m listening for those, I\'m digging for those.\n10:13\nAnd then I also look at their state, because you can do the same exact action from a place of being pissed off or from a place of playfulness and the same action is not gonna get you the\n10:21\nsame result. And so I\'m looking for that quality of what\'s going on in them, and then I look and try\n10:27\nto find out what it was like before. So Paul Tudor Jones, I went back and I watched videos of him when he was at his best and\n10:33\nI saw what he... how he used his body and the way he moved and I saw him now sitting still and kind of slumped over and he\'d broken his leg and he talked in a different\n10:41\ntempo. So I look at biochemically what\'s happening, physiologically, I look at psychologically\n10:46\nwhat\'s going on, and then I look at structurally what they\'re doing. And then I develop a plan to help them get back to where they were and beyond, to a better\n10:52\nperformance than they had before. Incredible. The other thing that I was fascinated for... I wanted to ask you so bad, you\'ve probably accomplished more than most people do in...\n11:02\nI can\'t even... I don\'t even know what time frame. And, of course, you get to talk with people who are at the highest level of their game.\n11:08\nWhen it comes to productivity, what do the top performers know that a lot of people just don\'t?\n11:14\nWhat are we missing? Well, I think the best performers are focused on outcomes and not activities. If you try to manage your to do list, in the world we live in today where most of us have\n11:21\nmultiple roles, we\'re trying to be a great businessperson, a great husband or wife, great father, great community member, whatever, there\'s just so many roles, you can never\n11:29\nget all of your to do\'s done. And what helped me in my life was I started at one point saying, I\'m not gonna let myself\n11:36\nfail every day. I\'m not gonna make a to do list and I\'m not gonna not write a list so that I don\'t fail.\n11:42\nI need to focus on what matters most. I need to discuss... organize my life into categories where I say, \"These are the most\n11:48\nimportant outcomes,\" and then I know why I\'m gonna do it. If you know what you really want, the target, and you know why, you have the focus and you\n11:56\nhave the fuel, then how to get there, there\'s so many ways to get there. And then the most important thing I think that most productive people do is we leverage\n12:04\nwhat we do. We don\'t delegate. Delegation is I give it to you and then when it doesn\'t work out, I\'m pissed at you.\n12:09\nLeverage is I empower you. If I\'m leverage, I\'m still part of that and I\'m gonna make sure you succeed. I\'m gonna follow up, I\'m gonna make sure before the deadline I touch base with you,\n12:18\nI\'m gonna make sure you have the resources to succeed. But what I do is empower people to go here\'s the outcome, here\'s the why. I get you and I aligned with the outcome and the why.\n12:25\nYou figure out how you wanna do it, I\'m open. You want to brainstorm with me, I\'ll do it.  You\'ll probably come up with better ideas than I do. And when you empower people to come up with their own how and they know what and why,\n12:35\nyou can get the job done 100 times faster, especially if you\'ve got a group of people. I\'m a big believer that... early in my life I thought I was just such a smart person.\n12:41\nI\'m gonna solve all this stuff. Part of it was being responsible and part of it is ego that we all have inside of ourselves\n12:46\nif we\'ve succeeded to a certain extent. I said, this is bullshit. You know what? Instead of one person solving 12 problems, I want 12 people to solve one problem.\n12:54\nAnd I developed that practice and I began to find that people that many people thought weren\'t gonna contribute had insights nobody else had.\n13:00\nI really got it from Steve Wynn. Steve Wynn is a dear friend of mine and he\'s built, you know, rebuilt Las Vegas, he\'s one of the most brilliant men I know, a multi billionaire, and Steve really learns the most\n13:08\nfrom the bellmen, from the people that would never make it into the C suite. He learns what customers are feeling, what they\'re experiencing, how to have an impact,\n13:15\nwhat needs to be changed. These people are on the front lines. So I\'m a big believer that you need leverage. And if you\'re just starting out in business, I know a lot of people that will probably\n13:23\nbe watching your shows are watching you because you\'re a successful businesswoman who\'s built your own entrepreneurship, you\'ve done so many great things.\n13:30\nI think in the very beginning the hard thing is you think you can only do it yourself and then there\'s only so many hours and you\'ve got kids and family and friends and how do\n13:37\nI do it all? The answer is you hire someone. You trade with someone. You trade them for 2 hours. That\'s what I did in the beginning.\n13:43\nBecause I remember, I remember, I\'ll never forget, I was just really young in my career, very in the early days, and I was running to get to the dry cleaners so I could get\n13:50\nmy only 2 suits because if I didn\'t get them, you know, then the place closes and I can\'t get on the plane.\n13:55\nAnd I was running to the airport sweating like crazy, and I\'m a sweater anyway. You and me both. Sweating like this, trying to get in the door, and it was like, what is wrong with this picture?\n14:04\nI could be doing something that\'s so productive and I\'m standing in line at the dry cleaning place.\n14:10\nThis is just nuts. And so I was really... I was like 17, 18, 19, I don\'t know what I was, and I said, \"I\'m gonna hire somebody.\" Two hours a day, that\'s what I need to start with.\n14:16\nAnd then it was 4 hours. And so my view is I don\'t do anything that someone else can do better, and I don\'t do anything that isn\'t the highest and best use of my time.\n14:22\nNow, when I say that, that\'s gross generalization. There are things I still do. But for the most part, by finding people and getting clear on outcomes on the why, what\n14:30\nI call RPM. You\'ve gotta know the result, you\'ve gotta know the purpose, and then you\'ve got to have a massive action plan. And the plan can change, but that RPM, the stronger the RPMs the faster that car is gonna\n14:40\nmove. And I try to do that not just through myself but through other people. Beautiful. So last thing I wanna talk about before we dive into the monster book, which I can\'t\n14:48\nwait to get to, is this idea of slumps. I know a lot of times you\'re called in when someone\'s, you know, either hit a plateau\n14:55\nor they\'re having a tough time. So two questions. A lot of folks that write in, they\'ll ask me questions or they\'ll just comment on\n15:01\nthe blog, and they find themselves in a tough spot. Maybe they\'ve experienced a certain level of success and, like you said with your friend\n15:07\nPeter, it\'s just like I don\'t want this anymore. I don\'t know what I want next. Any common patterns or things that you can share about slumps and how we can support\n15:16\nourselves to get out of them? Well, most people hit plateaus and the most important thing when you hit a plateau is\n15:21\nnot to be pissed off and stressed out about it because stress won\'t make it better. It\'s also not to take it lightly and go, \"Oh my God, this doesn\'t matter.\"\n15:28\nIt\'s that delicate balance where you say, \"Ok, how do I get from where I am to where I really wanna be?\" And if you don\'t put the emotional charge on it it\'s easier, but that\'s hard...\n15:36\neasier to say and harder to do. The pattern that I see in slumps, whether it be an athlete or, you know, a financial\n15:42\ntrader or an actor, any of that nature it is, number one thing that causes a slump usually\n15:47\nis you get too comfortable. When you start doing something and you\'re really successful, a lot of people lose their\n15:53\nhunger. If you ask me what is the single most important element of any human being that separates their level of success from the rest of the world, it\'s hunger.\n15:59\nIt isn\'t intelligence, as valuable as that is. There are people that are incredibly intelligent that can\'t fight their way out of a paper\n16:05\nbag. You show me somebody that\'s not only hungry but doesn\'t lose their hunger, they will dominate everything.\n16:10\nAnd you see that in the greatest sports stars, in the greatest entertainers, the ones that just... it\'s... they\'re insatiable. And because of that, you like being around them because there\'s this energy about them,\n16:18\nthis passion about them, and very few people maintain that. And you lose your hunger, you go into a slump.\n16:23\nYou get overconfident. Another pattern that happens that gives people a slump is when something changes in their\n16:28\nworld that they\'re not prepared for like, you know, I\'ve been doing this forever and, oh my God, now my relationship is messed up. Or, you know, I\'ve been working hard at being a lawyer and now my wife\'s upset or\n16:36\nhusband is upset with me. What do I got to do here? And what it does is it throws people off their rhythm.\n16:42\nAnd so I try to figure out what\'s happening in their environment and show them how they can win in both categories simultaneously. A third one is when people do something where they get mad at themselves, kinda like a Tiger\n16:52\nWoods, and then they... he\'s got all the skill in the world. Nothing changed in his skill. But for that year and a half or whatever it was, I mean, he was beating himself up.\n16:58\nYou know? And in that state, it\'s kind of a self sabotage. And so depending on what form I find I enter in and I make the changes and they\'re almost\n17:06\nalways changes, again, in the psychology of that person, the emotion of that person, because we\'re all... we all... we have these great minds.\n17:13\nEverybody\'s got a great mind, or at least available of a great mind. But we\'re emotional creatures and we forget that because we live in a society that tries\n17:20\nto value thought much more than emotion because emotion is scary for us. Emotion can come really fast. And so some people try to avoid it at all costs, other people overwhelm by it.\n17:29\nMy view is that emotional intelligence is a wonderful thing but I much prefer emotional fitness.\n17:34\nIntelligence is a capability. Fitness is a state of readiness. And what I do is I train myself to always be ready, and that makes you execute.\n17:43\nAnd I think too many people settle for I know this as opposed to I\'m doing this, and I\n17:49\ntry to train myself and others to be in that state of readiness all the time because that\'s where life is really fulfilled at the highest level, I think.\n17:55\nI do too. Agree 100%. So let\'s move on to this monster book, which it is a monster in the best way.\n18:02\nIt\'s the most beautiful thing. So do we have a copy that we can kind of bring in? I just wanna hold this thing up because it is so awesome.\n18:09\nSo, Tony, I got the galley from your team, which it\'s like... alright, y\'all.\n18:14\nYou\'re seeing it right here. We\'re gonna talk about this right now. I truly believe in my heart of hearts that every human being needs to get this book,\n18:21\nthey need to read it for their family, for their friends, and, most importantly, the last couple of chapters about service, I was in tears.\n18:27\nI loved every bit of it. My copy is highlighted cover to cover, I\'ve already taken action on a lot that\'s in\n18:33\nthe book. Yes. This is your first book in 20 years. Yes. Why this topic?\n18:39\nWhy now? And what makes it different than all the other money books that are out there? Well, one of the reasons I haven\'t written a book is I hate writing.\n18:46\nJust being honest. I, you know, I\'m on a plane about every 4 or 5 days, I go to 15 countries, I see a quarter of a million people a year.\n18:52\nI love the live event, I love the spontaneity, you know, you get to do something new constantly, you get to see what\'s really going on with a human being.\n18:58\nAnd writing is an isolated, by yourself process that God bless the people that do that stuff.\n19:04\nBut I got pushed over the edge because there\'s only a few subjects in life that really affect the quality of your life.\n19:09\nRight? There\'s your body, there\'s clearly your relationships, your emotions, and money is one of those places.\n19:15\nAnd I\'ve shared with people a lot about this and I grew up with a... in a very tough environment financially. We had no money.\n19:21\nThere were times, you know, our car was repossessed, there were times we had no food. So... and it didn\'t last, but it was one of those places where you had that uncertainty\n19:28\nall the time. And so when 2008 happened, that\'s what pushed me over the edge. Because when I started seeing so many people losing their homes, losing half of what they\'d,\n19:37\nyou know, saved for their whole life, and then I kept thinking, well, the government is gonna do something because this is... this is a raw, horrific situation that\'s been\n19:44\nbrought about by a small number of people. By 2010 when nothing had been done I was mad and I was...\n19:49\nI was reading every article, I was watching every documentary, and the final one that just pushed me over the edge was called Inside Job, I don\'t know if you saw it.\n19:57\nI have it ordered on Netflix. Ok, yeah. It\'s a... it\'s... Academy Award... it won the Academy Award. Matt Damon did the voiceover.\n20:03\nBut what\'s amazing is they systematically showed who specifically virtually destroyed the world economy and then showed that the punishment they got is not only all of us\n20:11\nbailing them out, but they\'re put in charge of turning the economy back around and giving\n20:16\nmore money to them again. So at the end of this film, you understand what happened but you have one of two emotional\n20:22\nresponses depending upon your personality. Either you wanna kill somebody you\'re so angry, or you\'re depressed because there wasn\'t one solution in the whole thing.\n20:27\nIt was a beautiful documentary, but not one solution. And I\'m a solution guy so I was like something\'s gotta be done. I know I\'m not the only solution, but I have a unique gift.\n20:35\nI have access. Because most people don\'t know, they think of me as the motivational, positive thinking guy, and it\'s never what I\'ve been. I\'ve been a strategist my whole life and Paul Tudor Jones, one of the top 10 traders\n20:43\nin the history of the world, has been my client for 21 years. Literally every single day he emails me, I [inaudible] him a variety of things, I see\n20:51\nhim face to face. I\'ve been with him side by side from the tech crash in 2000, in 9/11, you know, when\n20:58\nwe went through the subprime crisis, 2008, the fall in gold, and he\'s made money every single year for 21 years.\n21:04\nAnd even beyond me, his firm has made money for 28 years, so it isn\'t just me. It\'s Paul. And I\'ve learned from him so much over those decades and I just thought if I didn\'t just\n21:13\ninterview him, what if I interviewed 50 of the most brilliant financial minds that... in the history of the world.\n21:18\nThey\'re all alive today. Let me interview them, let me find out can the average person really still win? And, if so, how?\n21:23\nLet me get... not some talking head on television telling you the same BS about go put your money in some 12% [inaudible] mutual fund that\'s never existed for 10, 15 years, but\n21:32\nthe truth. And so I began this four year journey and, I mean, I was blown away. My average interview is scheduled for 45 minutes.\n21:39\nThey went 3 hours, some of them 3 and a half hours, one four hours. And people became incredibly generous in what they shared, and they shared things that they\'ve\n21:47\nnever shared before and I\'ve put them into a 7 step process so that whether you\'re a millennial that just got out of college and you\'ve got a bunch of college debt saying,\n21:53\n\"How will I ever get around this?\" I\'ll show you how to get financially free. You\'re, you know, a baby boomer and you lost a bunch of money in 2008 and you didn\'t\n22:00\nget back in the market, I\'ll show you what you can do. You\'re a very sophisticated investor and you wanna know what [inaudible] does that\'s\n22:06\nnever been revealed about him? I\'ll show you what he does. And so I\'m real proud of it and, you know, you\'ve seen the level of diversement I have\n22:11\nfrom the highest level of people in finances on the earth. It\'s really pretty extraordinary, it\'s because it\'s really their work.\n22:17\nIt\'s not mine. It\'s... I had so much fun reading it, and honestly I was intimidated by a 600 plus book because\n22:22\nI knew we were doing this interview and I prepare as much as I humanly... I\'m like, alright, I\'m gonna speed read but digest everything.\n22:29\nAnd one of the things in the beginning when you start breaking down the myths. Yes. I just kept getting sicker and sicker and sicker...\n22:36\nI know, me too. ...with how much the general public, how much people don\'t know and how they\'re taken\n22:43\nadvantage of. So I wanted to ask you, was there one in particular that just totally pissed you off?\n22:48\nThere was a ton. I know there\'s 9 myths in the book. There\'s... I put the 9 most abusive ones.\n22:53\nYeah. I mean, they\'re there. Here\'s what I\'d say, I want to mention one of the myths though to start with, not\n22:58\na myth but a step. I want everybody who\'s watching to remember one thing. The biggest myth you have, not that\'s been sold to you, that hurts you is the average\n23:08\nperson thinks finance is so complex because, frankly, the industry tries to make it sound\n23:13\ncomplex. They use words that you don\'t know so you don\'t know what to do. You know, what does this mean? And so what happens is we just give them our money and say, \"Deal with it,\" and we\n23:21\ndon\'t realize that system has been set up. It\'s not an evil system. It\'s set up by corporations that are looking to maximize profit for those corporations.\n23:28\nThey\'re not looking out for the investor because this investor is second. And we think we\'re first, and we\'re not.\n23:33\nSo the first piece is you\'ve got to know that you\'ve got to... you can\'t wait until you have a ton of money to start investing and think, \"I\'m not an investor.\"\n23:41\nWhat you\'ve got to do is say, \"Rather than my Apple phone, let me own Apple stock. Let me own a piece of all of the best companies, not just Apple.\n23:47\nI\'ve got to become an owner or I\'ll always be in scarcity.\" If you can invest in business, even a small amount, you can grow.\n23:54\nAnd I don\'t care how small it is, but you\'ve got to automate it. There\'s a gentleman named Theodore Johnson who, he\'s amazing, he worked for UPS, started\n24:02\nas a driver, never made more than 14 thousand total in a year. That was his highest salary in a year.\n24:08\nIn his old age he\'s worth 70 million dollars. And how did he do it? All he did is what I teach you is the first step, is you\'ve gotta take a percentage\n24:16\nof what you earn and pretend it\'s a tax. You\'re never gonna see that money again, you automate it, it goes straight to the investment\n24:22\naccount, and you never see it as money you can spend. He did that with 20%. He said, \"I can\'t save 5.\"\n24:28\nSomebody in his family said, \"If there was a tax you\'d pay it,\" and he made it 20%. When you save 20% and you compound it, numbers are incredible.\n24:35\nSo I show people how to do that. But then the problem is if you do that first step but you don\'t do the second step, which\n24:41\nis you become an insider. Yes. And understand the rules of the game. Then the old adage is a person with money meets a person with experience, the person\n24:48\nwith experience ends up with your money. That\'s how it works. So what\'re... I\'ll give you 2 or 3 of the myths real fast. One, this myth that someone says, \"Give me your money and I\'m gonna beat the market.\"\n24:58\nIt is... it\'s just a lie. Warren Buffett made it clear it\'s a lie, Ray Dalio, one of the greatest investors in history, David Swenson who has taken Yale\'s money, a billion dollars, and converted it\n25:08\ninto 24 billion in two decades, the greatest institutional investor in the world. They\'ve all said it. Warren Buffett flat out said today, he said, \"Listen, in my will 90% of my money, all\n25:17\nof that money does not go with any mutual fund. It goes straight into the index.\" What the index is, you get a piece of all of the largest companies in the world but\n25:23\nit costs almost nothing to get in because over any 10 year period of time, 96% of mutual\n25:30\nfunds will not even match the market. Now, you\'re paying for a mutual fund. What this means is you hire someone because you say, \"I have a family, I have a business,\n25:38\nI have a life. I\'m not an investor. I\'m gonna hire someone who\'s a professional. It makes sense. They would do better than me.\"\n25:44\nUnfortunately that\'s wrong. Because what happens is 4% of them will beat the market, but it\'s not the same 4%.\n25:51\nSo your chances of finding the right one... have you ever played Blackjack? Yes. So if you play Blackjack, everybody knows, you play for 21.\n25:58\nIf you go above 21 you\'re gone. If you get 2 face cards and they\'re sitting in front of you and you\'ve got a 20 out of 21, you have the chance to stay or say, \"Hit me.\"\n26:05\nIf they hit you, there\'s only one card that\'ll get you there, it\'s an Ace. If your inner idiot says, \"Hit me,\" you have an 8% chance of winning.\n26:12\nYou have a 4% chance of finding the right mutual fund. It\'s not gonna happen. So what happens for people is they think, they\'ve been sold, we\'re gonna do better,\n26:20\nand they might for a year or two, but what matters you live off the long term. You don\'t live off the year or two.\n26:26\nAnd they just don\'t do it. Warren Buffett has a bet right now with Protege Partners, which is a group that does hedge\n26:31\nfunds, and he said you can pick 5 hedge funds. You can mold the best of them together. I\'m gonna own the market, which costs me next to nothing.\n26:37\nYou\'re gonna get the hedge funds, which cost a lot. 10 year bet, who\'s gonna win? Put up a million bucks. Right now they\'re 6 years into it, Warren Buffett is at 42%, they\'re at 12%.\n26:45\nIt\'s just crazy. So the second thing is after getting terrible performance, people say, \"Well, fees don\'t\n26:51\nreally matter,\" or they\'ll tell you, \"It\'s only 1%.\" And I... I ask people all the time, \"How much are you paying?\"\n26:57\nAnd they go, \"Uh, I don\'t know,\" or they\'ll say 1%. One percent is called the expense ratio. That\'s like the edge of the sticker price.\n27:04\nIf you read that 50 page perspectives in your mutual fund, even one of them is 50 pages, which you won\'t, you\'d have a hard time with a PhD figuring it out.\n27:11\nIn fact, there\'s a man named Hilton Smith I quote in the book who spent two weeks and he\'s got a doctorate as an economist, it took him 2 weeks to go through them all and\n27:20\nfigure out there\'s 17 different fees and Forbes says the average fee is 3.12. Now, if you\'re watching right now, I\'m sure I have lost your brain with all of these\n27:27\nnumbers. Let me make it real for you. One percent versus 3 percent, big difference.\n27:32\nHuge. Right? Here\'s the difference. Just like you grow by compounding, like Theodore Johnson did, your fees also compound.\n27:39\nAnd people don\'t know that when they hear that little number. So if you had 3 people and one gets one percent in fees, two percent, the other three percent,\n27:47\nthey all get the same return. They start out with 100 thousand dollars at 35. For 30 years they accumulate to 65 years old, 7 percent compounded.\n27:55\nThey all get 7 percent. The only difference is the fees. And when they go to retire, the person at 1% in fees is gonna have 574 thousand dollars.\n28:03\n100 thousand to 574, not bad. If they added not another dime, it\'d be amazing. The person at 3% in fees will have 224 thousand dollars.\n28:12\n77% less money. If you wanna win a race and you have a 100 pound jockey on the back of your horse or do you want a 300 pound jockey on the back of your horse?\n28:18\nFees at 3 percent are that. If I said to you, here\'s a deal. Let\'s do an investment and here\'s how I want it to work.\n28:24\nYou give me the money. You put up all the money, you put up all the risk. I\'ll put up no money, I\'ll put up no risk.\n28:29\nIf you lose, I win and if you win, I win. And if you win, over the life of the time. I\'ll get 60% of what you earn, you\'d say, \"I\'ll never do that in a million years.\"\n28:38\nThat\'s a mutual fund with 3%. It\'s one of the only industries on earth where they\'ve confused us enough that we\n28:44\ndon\'t  understand overpaying by thousands of percent. You could own the stock market, the SMP 500, you can own a piece of all 500 big companies,\n28:52\nthey\'re like the Vanguard 500, and you get the best of all the business. Apple, Exxon, all these companies.\n28:58\nAnd it costs you .17. That means less than 2 tenths of a percent.\n29:03\nIf you went with a normal mutual fund you might own the same companies for 3.17. That\'s like buying a Honda Accord for 20 thousand or 350 thousand for the same car.\n29:12\nIf you paid 350 thousand and you\'re looking at the person next door paid 20 thousand, you\'d go crazy. That happens every day with finances because people don\'t know how to look at this.\n29:20\nSo when they read the book, that\'ll never happen to them again. Yeah, and this is... I mean, there\'s so much. I could talk to you forever, and I know your team is like, \"Oh my God, we\'ve gotta\n29:26\nget him out of here,\" but a couple of things before we wrap up. First, what we discover with the All Season strategy and what you were able to inspire\n29:35\nRay, one of the... the leader of what, the largest head fund... hedge fund in the world.\n29:40\nIt\'s absolutely incredible. He\'s an amazing man. Let me just give it to you really quick. Ray Dalio is his name.\n29:46\nRay heads Bridgewater, which is the largest hedge fund in the world. A hedge fund is where wealthy people often put their money because they can bet up on\n29:52\nthe market or down, and be able to do a lot of things as a hedge fund. And a large hedge fund, a good sized one, might be 15 billion.\n29:58\nRay\'s 160 billion, so he\'s 10 times the size. To give money to Ray 10 years ago you had to have a 5 billion dollar net worth and a\n30:05\nminimum of 100 million on the first day or he wouldn\'t even talk to you. That was 10 years ago. Now no matter how much money you have he won\'t do it because he manages money for China,\n30:12\nfor countries, for giant pension funds. So I get a chance to meet Ray and I did 15 hours of prep for that.\n30:19\nYou know, just like every... I wanna be able to pitch and catch with him. I was very fortunate to find out that he\'d listened to my tapes and was a fan of my work\n30:24\nfrom years before, and so our 45 minutes went close to that 3 hour mark again. And at the end I said to him, we\'re back and forth, back and forth, and he really enjoyed\n30:31\nit and I enjoyed it, obviously. I learned so much. I said, \"Ray,\" I asked this to all these people. \"If you could never give any of your money to your children and all you could give them\n30:40\nwas a strategy, a plan, you know, a portfolio that they could not only succeed with but\n30:46\nthey wouldn\'t have all of the ups and downs that make people get out of the market and lose.\" I said, \"What would it be?\"\n30:51\nAnd he said, \"My all weather portfolio. I\'ve already designed it, all of my money is in it, my kids money, all of the money that I have for contribution to society is in it,\" and I said... and he said, \"Because\n30:58\nI know I\'m not gonna be here forever and I need something that\'s gonna work in any market.\" And he said, \"I\'ve worked it all the way back to 1925, I\'ve tested it, and it makes\n31:06\nmoney,\" and he said, \"I did it for myself for years and now I do it for my clients.\" I said, \"Explain it to me.\" So he explained it to me and I\'d done my homework, I knew a lot about it already.\n31:13\nBut at the end I said, \"Ok, Ray. You\'ve really explained this brilliant. You\'re showing me why in 2008 people that had half their money in stocks and they thought\n31:20\nthey were safe, half of their money in bonds, like everybody tells you a balanced portfolio. They\'ve both lost money.\" He explained why. He explained how you can avoid that.\n31:26\nBut I said, \"Ray, you told me everything but the percentages.\" So it\'s like bake this perfect chocolate cake and he says, \"Bring some chocolate,\n31:32\nbring some sugar, you know, use some dairy products,\" but you\'re not telling me the\n31:38\namounts. I said, \"That\'s...\" he said, \"Tony, that\'s my secret sauce,\" and he gave me the whole 5 billion, 100 million. I go, \"I know, I know, but you said you haven\'t taken money in 10 years. You\'re not gonna take any money.\n31:44\nYou know the average person can\'t do it on their own. Help the average guy out!\" And I was teasing him, pushing him, and he goes, \"Well, it\'s complex.\"\n31:51\nI said... \"But I\'ll simplify.\" He goes, \"Well, there\'s nothing.\" I said, \"Write... design one without leverage. The average person can do 15 minutes a year.\"\n31:57\nHe goes, \"Well, it wouldn\'t be perfect.\" I said, \"Your idea of not perfect would be better than anybody else on earth.\" Totally.\n32:03\nSo he sits there and he starts scratching this thing out for me, and I\'m like feeling this vibration in my body, it was just incredible.\n32:08\nAt the end, it was incredibly generous, we went and tested it, back tested it, so that means you compare it year by year what it did.\n32:14\nReality, not hoping what it\'d do, but, you know, back testing something for a year or 2 years or 5 years is one thing.\n32:19\nWe back tested it 75 years. The worst and the most volatile times in our history and, interestingly enough, it\'s\n32:25\nright 85% of the time it made money and the few times it didn\'t the average loss was 1.6%.\n32:32\nThe largest loss in 75 years was less than 4%. Minus 3.5.\n32:38\nAnd that was 2008 when the market from top to bottom was down 51%. And that\'s the most in loss in 75 years and the average return is just under 10%.\n32:46\nAnd this is something... a bunch of my friends were like, \"Bake this into a business, dude. This is, like, incredible.\"\n32:52\nAnd I was like, \"You know what? I\'d love to do that, but this was given in the spirit of free to anybody.\"\n32:57\nYes. So it\'s there. Somebody can go to the library and get my book and they can just copy the thing down. But it\'s... it\'s available to any human being and anybody can put it there.\n33:03\nNow, that\'s not the only strategy there. I have David Winston\'s strategies, I have all the best. Tons. But his strategy is the smoothest ride.\n33:09\nBecause the biggest challenge, if you look at the last 30 years or 20 years, 1993 to\n33:14\n2003, the average investor in mutual funds... well, the market did 9.2% per year, really nice, on average.\n33:21\nThe average mutual fund investor did 2.5%, and that\'s before taxes. You\'re gonna double your money every 36 years doing something like that.\n33:30\nIt\'s just... Getting killed. ...it\'s not gonna happen. No. You\'re getting killed. Ok.\n33:36\nAs we wrap. So you\'re not earning a dime off of this book. No. No. So tell us all about your passion for making a difference and what happens each and every\n33:42\ntime someone purchases a copy of this incredible thing, which everyone needs to get. Thank you. I\'m really proud.\n33:47\nIt didn\'t start out that great, frankly, but I was writing the book and as I mentioned, you know, I was a kid, we had Thanksgiving, no money and no food and somebody came to\n33:54\nthe door, knocked on the door, delivered this food, and it was life changing for me because it wasn\'t the food, it was that my father had always said, \"Nobody cares about anybody\n34:04\nelse.\" You know, he built that belief system into us. And then I saw that strangers really care. And so I swore some day I\'d do something to give back, so when I was 17 I fed two families.\n34:13\nThe next year 4 families, the next 8, and I didn\'t tell anybody but after the third, 4th year I was like, \"I could use some help.\"\n34:18\nSo I got my friends involved and my companies, and then it built to a million people and then 2 million people. In the last 4 or 5 years I\'ve been matching the 2 million my foundation does personally\n34:26\nwith another 2 million, so we feed 4 million people a year. But while I was writing this, Congress last year passed a new budget that nobody seemed\n34:33\nto pay attention to where they cut food stamps... they don\'t call it food stamps anymore, but it\'s food stamps, by 8.7 billion.\n34:39\nBasically limiting 2 million people from having food. And so I work with all these nonprofit organizations that are already struggling, and I... it just\n34:47\nmade me crazy and I thought, \"Ok, what if I...\" I\'m working my ass off with this book but, you know what, I can...\n34:53\nI can donate all the profits. Not a percentage. And then I thought, \"What if I donate it all in advance? Whether I make money on the book, it doesn\'t matter.\n34:58\nI\'m gonna do it in advance. How many people could I feed?\" and it was 10 million. And I was like, \"Wow.\" That excited me.\n35:03\nAnd it just grew a life of its own. As time went by I started thinking, \"How can I really get people\'s attention about\n35:09\nit?\" And so I finally decided that I\'m gonna feed 50 million, I\'m writing the check, actually, next week. Personally I\'m gonna feed 50 million people upfront and in addition to that I\'m working\n35:19\nwith Feeding America, they\'re the best hunger relief organization in the United States. And they\'re gonna partner with me to get matching funds so we can feed 100 million\n35:25\npeople. And it\'s just exciting. I\'ve fed 42 million people in my life, I\'m gonna feed more people this year, and... so\n35:31\nfor anybody who gets a book, you know, if I sell a million books, 50 meals for every person that\'s there. If I sell 100 books it\'ll be 500 thousand meals.\n35:39\nBut it doesn\'t matter, I\'ve done it up front. And I\'m... I\'m... I\'m not doing it because I\'m a good guy, I\'m just paying it forward.\n35:45\nI... people forget what a little bit of caring can do for, you know, to inspire or to move\n35:50\nsomebody. And I don\'t even know to this day who fed my family that day, but if they\'re out there,\n35:56\nif they\'re still alive, I hope they see and hear this story and know what\'s going on. My guess is they\'ve passed because I\'ve shared this story many times and no one\'s\n36:02\nvolunteered to share what it is. But that person made a giant difference. It wasn\'t just feeding, it was caring, and that\'s what I think changes people\'s lives.\n36:10\nI think that\'s the thing that I so admire about you. I\'ve been to so many of your events, I will continue to be a supporter, a fan, a friend.\n36:17\nThank you. I think you\'re one of the most incredible human beings in the world and your heart and your soul shows through in everything that you do.\n36:25\nThank you. Thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it. And for everybody, you have got to get your hands on this book.\n36:31\nWe\'re gonna have links below, we\'re gonna be tweeting and sharing about it. It will change your life, the life of your family, and, like I said, at the end there\'s\n36:38\na beautiful piece about why it\'s so important for all of us to make a difference. Tony, thank you so much.\n36:44\nI love you. Thank you for having me on, it\'s so beautiful to see you again. Thank you. Thank you.\n36:49\nNow Tony and I would love to hear from you.

The answer is, believe it or not, I actually don\'t have schematics\n0:21\nfor this thing, I never sat down and drew out a full schematic.\n0:27\nBecause of how modular everything is, or how modular this architecture is,\n0:31\nI was able to build each piece of it by itself, and build it, and test it, and experiment with\n0:38\none module at a time, before I had to put it all together. It wasn\'t really until all the pieces came together\n0:45\nthat I really had to be a little bit more thoughtful about how it was all going to work.\n0:50\nFor that I had this really good model to follow in this book that I really recommend,\n0:55\n\"Digital Computer Electronics\", by Albert Paul Malvino.\n0:58\nUnfortunately, I think the book is out of print, but hopefully you can find a used copy online\n1:04\nor something. This book has an architecture... has a couple architectures.\n1:09\nOne is the SAP-1, which is, \"simple as possible\". The goal is to be a very simple computer architecture,\n1:18\nthat demonstrates all the crucial ideas behind computer operation\n1:21\nwithout being any more complicated than it needs to be.\n1:26\nThe architecture that they have in here, is basically the model that I followed,\n1:31\nwhat I based this computer on. So you can see that all of the same components are there.\n1:35\nThere\'s a program counter here, there\'s the memory address register,\n1:39\nthe 16 bytes of memory that are used, programmable read only memory,\n1:44\nI\'ve got RAM but, same difference, as far as the operation is concerned.\n1:49\nAn instruction register, the control unit, which is all this stuff down here,\n1:53\nand you can see that they have all these signals going out, that come back in\n1:57\nto all the other components, and that\'s what all these yellow wires are.\n1:59\nThey\'re all the control signals. They come from the control unit and go out\n2:02\nto all the different pieces to orchestrate everything.\n2:05\nThe accumulator, which is the A register here. The ALU, which is the arithmetic\n2:11\nlogic unit, which in this computer, just adds and subtracts.\n2:14\nThose are the only arithmetic operations it knows how to do.\n2:17\nAnd then the B register. The A and the B register are the inputs for the arithmetic.\n2:23\nAnd the output register, they have a binary display, I\'ve got a decimal display\n2:27\nwhich I thought was a little nicer.\n2:29\nThat\'s one enhancement that I made.\n2:32\nI made a few other enhancements to this as well, primarily around the instruction set\n2:36\nand what you can actually do with it.\n2:38\nThe model here in the book, it talks about the instructions having a\n2:42\n\"load A\" instruction, an add instruction, subtract, output, and halt, and that\'s it.\n2:48\nI added a couple other things. I added a load immediate, which just lets you\n2:52\nsave a little bit of memory, if you wanted to load a particular value into the A register.\n2:57\nAnd then a \"store A\" command, which in addition to the \"load A,\" which loads the accumulator\n3:03\nfrom memory, you can store what\'s in the accumulator to memory.\n3:06\nSo that let\'s you build a little bit more complex programs.\n3:10\nI also added jump instructions, which I thought were pretty important\n3:13\nfor a programmable computer. There\'s a regular jump instruction,\n3:16\nthere\'s also a conditional jump instruction, that jumps when the carry bit is set,\n3:20\nanytime the addition over flows.\n3:24\nSo you might still be wondering, can I just tell you how to build this thing already,\n3:30\ncan you draw up a schematic or something like that? Well, I\'ve got some good news.\n3:34\nThat is exactly what I plan to do, to make a bunch of videos, that go through every step of the process.\n3:40\nI am planning to actually build a whole new copy of this computer from scratch,\n3:46\nand have videos of all of it. The bad news is that it\'s going to take a while.\n3:52\nI don\'t have a ton of free time, unfortunately, but my personal goal is to make one video a week,\n4:02\nat a minimum. So we\'ll see how well that goes, but even with that, I want to make sure I\'m covering\n4:08\neverything from first principles, not leaving any mystery about why things work the way that they do.\n4:14\nI don\'t wanna ask you to take anything on faith, but going step by step,\n4:20\nprobably means it\'s going to take a while to get to everything. So at least...\n4:25\nat least a few months. Probably longer. I hope that it will be worth the wait. My goal, and I\'m convinced that\n4:34\nanyone can build this computer. As long as you\'re patient enough to wire it all up, carefully,\n4:42\nand you have the persistence to troubleshoot the inevitable wrong connections,\n4:47\nor broken connections or something. I\'m convinced that anyone can build this and really understand\n4:54\nat a very deep level, how a computer works, by building this. Even if you, don\'t have any experience with\n5:00\nthis sort of thing, or with electronics. In fact I really hope, I\'m really looking forward to that happening, and\n5:06\npeople building these things, and improving on it even. So, I think for the next videos, I\'m going to be\n5:15\ntraveling over the next week, so it may be in a couple weeks before I can get the next video up.\n5:20\nMy goal is to just start focusing on the clock, as the first steps, and walk through\n5:29\nbuilding this, the clock circuit, from scratch. There\'s a couple interesting things going on here.\n5:34\nThe clock, of course, coordinates everything in the computer, the timing of everything.\n5:40\nIn this case, you can adjust the speed of the clock, you can see here I\'m slowing it down,\n5:45\nso everything else is running slower. You can also stop the clock, and then step one step at a time,\n5:54\nwhich is very useful for troubleshooting something, if something isn\'t working, which inevitably,\n5:59\nif you build this you\'re going to run into a point where something isn\'t working, and you need to\n6:03\ngo step by step. A couple features that are of the clock, is that it uses the 5-5-5 timers,\n6:08\nso I will go through how those work, and they\'re being used in a couple different applications,\n6:13\nin the clock circuit. So, I think that that\'s the next thing that I\'ll do, the next set of videos.\n6:17\nYou can look forward to seeing those. I hope you\'re as excited as I am about this.\n6:23\nAgain, I ask for your patience, it\'s going to take a while to get through it all,\n6:26\nbut I hope it will be worth it. If this is exciting to you, please give this video a thumbs up,\n6:33\nand subscribe to the channel, tell all your friends, cause if you like what you see,\n6:38\nknowing that people find these videos valuable, is really motivating to me, so\n6:43\nsubscribing and watching the videos, is honestly the best way to make sure that I\n6:48\nkeep working on them. Thanks for watching.',14,6);
